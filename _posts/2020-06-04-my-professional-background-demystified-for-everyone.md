title: "My professional background demystified for everyone"
published: true
---

I have often been asked to describe my professional background. Since
computational engineering is a relatively new field, giving the right answer,
"computational scientist," is seldom a sufficient response. The same goes for my
graduate degree in engineering mechanics, which people easily mistake for
mechanical engineering. Alternative answers like scientist, software engineer,
or mathematician are either unintentionally misleading, or fail to do justice to
my background. I am often left with spontaneously condensing years of my diverse
experience into a few sentences, tailored for the person I am talking to. So,
here is my professional background demystified for laypersons, engineers, and
experts:

## For laypersons
Being a computational scientist, I solve different types of math equations (that
cannot be solved by hand) using computers. These equations describe the world
around us, and solving them helps us predict how things behave. For example, I
have studied how water floods the coast and rivers when huge storms called
hurricanes hit coastal cities.

My work is generally divided into projects spanning several months to a few
years. In order to keep the explanation simple, say we have a project about *an
apple falling from a tree*, and we wish to find *the time it takes for the apple
to hit the ground*. I typically work on the following three aspects of the
project:
- **Science**: *Understanding how things behave.* <br/>
  This involves observing that the apple falls down in a straight line and that
  gravity is involved.
- **Mathematics**: *Dealing with equations.* <br/>
  This involves finding the right equations that accurately tell us how things
  would behave once we solve them; for example, how fast the apple moves when it
  is falling. We then find ways to solve these equations. Fun fact: we often
  make these equations look horrifying to others to protect our jobs. &#128521;
  Just kidding!
- **Software**: *Making it easy to solve equations.* <br/>
  For big and real problems, often the only way to solve the equations is using
  computers. So, we write a software to do that. In fact, we make sure that the
  software is able to tell us how much time any apple (and not just yours)
  would take to hit the ground.

Essentially, my work lets people facing engineering problems (much bigger than
the apple one) find answers quickly.

## For engineers
I specialize in understanding the physics behind engineering problems,
utilizing or designing mathematical techniques to solve them, and making it
quick and easy to find their solution by writing computer code. I design,
create, and use high-performance computing (HPC) software that simulate
real-world phenomena.

I have worked on numerous projects in different fields, all of which require
knowledge of at least one of *engineering*, *mathematics*, and *computer
science*, which are the pillars of computational engineering. One of my first
major projects used image processing and neural networks for monitoring cracks
in concrete surfaces. My first professional experience was designing buildings
made of concrete and steel. Thereafter, I studied how nearby explosions deform
certain materials, and worked on reducing the weight and cost of trusses without
compromising on their safety. I continued into research in my first job, where I
wrote a computer software to automate finding stresses in ship structures and
airplane wings, given their shape and material. Over the last six years, I have
worked on numerous projects on improving computer models that simulate how water
moves in oceans, rivers, and below the ground, particularly during extreme
events such as hurricanes.

## For experts
My expertise is in solving partial differential equations using numerical
methods in a high-performance computing (HPC) setting. My research interests and
past projects span a multitude of fields including computational mechanics,
numerical methods, coupled models, finite element analysis, scientific
programming, parallel computing, machine learning, and heuristic and
mathematical optimization.

I have been an active contributor to *Adaptive Hydraulics (AdH)* and *ADvanced
CIRCulation (ADCIRC)*, which are HPC software used for simulating ocean
dynamics, respectively written in C and Fortran. I am experienced in
using Python to modernize legacy HPC codes written in Fortran and C/C++, opening
up new avenues of research such as multi-software coupling and physics-informed
machine learning. I have also created an HPC Python software called the *Water
Coupler (WaCoup)*, a framework for two-way weak/flux coupling between different
HPC CFD models. I have worked on 2D/3D shallow water, 2D/3D transport, 3D
groundwater, 2D/1D diffusive wave, and atmospheric models. My work enables
simulation of complex phenomena such as compound flooding from combined
effects of torrential rainfall and storm surge during hurricanes,
wetting/drying in 3D baroclinic shallow water models, and coupled overland and
groundwater flow.
